# Price of pizza slices in NYC 


## Step one: the visualization

The data chosen to visulaize was [NYC Pizza Slice] (https://elkue.com/nyc-slice/)

The reason I chose to work on the redesign for this data was just because of how interesting this was. While I understand that overall, NYC has a LOT of pizza joints, there are so many things I am curious about - why the author chose to do this, why did he only try two specific kinds of pizzas, well at least majority of the time, and most importantly how he was consistent with it for more than 8 years! While looking at the data and analyzing it, I felt that there was something more that can be shown through this. Not just about pizza slices and their prices but also something about the economy as a whole. 

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
