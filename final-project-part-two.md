# Story Outline
> I added this section since I changed my topic from what it was in Part I

## Walking to work in Pittsburgh

More than just a mode of transportation, walking to work is a reflection of how cities are planned, how people interact with their urban surroundings, and how mobility impacts both environmental and human well-being. Walking is still a common way to commute in Pittsburgh, a city renowned for its hills, bridges, and small neighbourhoods. Pittsburgh has the third-highest percentage of walking commuters among major U.S. cities, with 11.3% of its workforce walking, according to five years' worth of data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey. This puts the city just behind Boston (15.1%) and Washington, D.C. (12.1%), and ahead of New York City (10.3%).

A possible explanation for Pittsburghâ€™s high rate of walking commuters could be its historic urban fabric, which was developed before the dominance of the automobile. This may have resulted in a pedestrian-friendly environment with mixed-use districts and relatively short commuting distances. Another potential factor is the presence of major universities, such as the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, where student populations might contribute significantly to the number of walking commuters. 

Though the city might have multiple colleges and pedestrain friendly environments, there could be some neighbourhoods within Pittsburgh that might not have a high density of people who walk to work. Exploring Pittsburgh's walking commute patterns offers policymakers and urban planners important information. In the face of transportation issues, public health emergencies, and climate change, encouraging walkability might be a useful tactic for sustainable urban growth. Improvements to pedestrian infrastructure, such as larger sidewalks, safer crosswalks, and improved lighting, can promote walking even more and improve locals' quality of life. Other cities can implement comparable tactics to encourage healthier and more sustainable urban environments by learning what makes Pittsburgh a leader in pedestrian commuting.

This study and data visualization aims to identify neighnorhoods in Pittsburh with high denisty of people walking to work. Using that as a provocation, patterns that "could" influenece walkability will be identified, such as location of colleges, hospitals or even work places. Through this the inferneces will govern the call to action steps that would help increase the population that walk to work in Pittsburgh. 


# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
For this project there could be a few levels of the target audience.

1. Primary Audience
   - Neighborhood/county level organization leaders or representatives could use this data to assess the pedestrain friendly quality that exists in their neighborhood. The findings from this project could also inform them as what to focus on redesigning or implementing by taking examples from neighborhoods that have a high density of people who walk o work.
2. Secondary Audience
   - Policy makers and urban planners could use this data to understand where to provide better pedestrain amenities. As they are interested in understanding walkability trends to inform transportation planning, zoning regulations, and infrastructure investments the data could help guide policies that support pedestrian-friendly urban design.
3. Tertiary Audience
   - Scholars, especially within the subject of the built environment, transportation researchers, and students studying city planning, mobility, or sustainability could find your data valuable for comparative studies, this research could contribute to discussions about how urban design influences commuting behaviors.
   - This data and reserach would also be useful for the general public encourage more residents to walk by highlighting the benefits and feasibility of pedestrian commuting

|                                        | Why do some neighborhoods have a higher density of people walking to work?                     |
| To understand proximity                | Does the presence of universities/offices close to certain neighborhoods encourage walking?    |
| To address pedestrian safety           | Do people choose to walk more when they feel the environment around them is conducive to walking? |
|                                        | Does the maintenance or presence of sidewalks increase the number of people who choose to walk? |
