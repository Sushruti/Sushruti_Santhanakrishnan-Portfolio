# The final data story

The project focuses on how walking to work in Pittsburgh is a preferred choice for many commuters. To start with, the analysis compares Pittsburgh’s performance to other major cities in America. This provides an overview and background for the entire study, offering context and sparking interest. Who would have thought that Pittsburgh would rank 3rd in the nation for walking commuters?

Using that as a provocation, the analysis maps out the density of people who walk to work by neighborhood. This allows us to see which neighborhoods have the highest and lowest numbers of walking commuters. By analyzing these patterns, we can identify why certain neighborhoods encourage walking over other modes of transportation. For neighborhoods with fewer walking commuters, the data helps us understand the barriers that may be preventing more people from choosing to walk.

Looking closely at why certain neighborhoods have more walking commuters, we start to identify key patterns based on land use, proximity to workplaces and institutions, road network quality, and sidewalk maintenance. The analysis highlights Pittsburgh’s three major employment hubs—Downtown, Oakland, and East Liberty—where walkability is naturally high due to the concentration of offices, universities, and hospitals. Many people choose to live near their workplaces in these areas to simplify commuting. Oakland, in particular, stands out as a hub for educational and medical institutions, making it essential to study its worker population and the role of institutional employment in walkability patterns. The analysis also explores other factors that influence walking, such as public transportation access, safety, and street design, providing insights into how other neighborhoods could improve walkability.

By mapping walkability trends and breaking down what makes certain neighborhoods more pedestrian-friendly, this analysis helps us see where Pittsburgh is doing well and where there’s room for improvement. It gives us a clearer idea of why some areas naturally support walking while others don’t, which could spark conversations about how to make more neighborhoods walkable. Whether it's improving sidewalks, adding better crosswalks, there are real opportunities to make walking an easier and more attractive option across the city. 

# Changes made since Part II

During my Part II interviews, some of the comments were adding pictures to make the story more relatable - specifically pictures that represent the factors that influence walking.

While some comments also said that maps maybe not be familiar to everyone, I tried to make the maps as legible as possible and added legends too. 

## The audience
The target audience chosen for this project I feel is importnat because they play a direct role in shaping the built environment and influencing policies that impact walkability. 

Urban planners design cities with pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, ensuring that streets, sidewalks, and public spaces support walking as a viable commuting option. 

City and policy makers make decisions on funding, zoning regulations, and transportation policies that can either encourage or hinder walkability. 

Community leaders are essential because they represent local voices, push for improvements in pedestrian infrastructure, and help ensure that walkability initiatives align with the needs of residents. 

Together, these groups have the power to implement real changes that make Pittsburgh more walkable, sustainable, and accessible for everyone.


## Final design decisions

For this analysis, I chose to work with ArcGIS because I found it a lot more easier to use than Tableau for making maps. I used Tableau to visulaise other data sets in the form of graphs. 

I also loosely followed a colour palette, the choices were more defined by the colors from ArcGIS pro rather than choosing a palette on my own.

Because of the lack of time, my analysis only focuses on the major patterns that influenence walkabilty, though I would have liked to expand on it and go into detail with a lot more data visualizations.

# Final thoughts
The final project was a good exercise that allowed me to use some of the principles learned throughout the course. I would have liked to work on the content of the data a little more than I did, but due to time constraints, I was not able to do so. Either way, I feel like I have learned some valuable skills that I can use in my other classes as well!
